                <h4><span class="fw-bold">4.4. How Pension Savvy Responds to Browser “Do Not Track” (DNT) Signals</span> </h4>
                <p>
                    Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not
                    Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor does not want to have
                    their online activity and behavior tracked. If a web service operator elects to respond to a
                    particular DNT signal, the web service operator may refrain from collecting certain personal
                    information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no
                    industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many web service
                    operators, including Pension Savvy, do not proactively respond to DNT signals. For more
                    information about DNT signals, visit

                <p>
                    Please note that we will need to verify your identity before we are able to process any of the

                    required.

                <p>
                    If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (<span class="fw-bold">“EEA”</span>), when we process your
                    personal data, we will only do so in the following situations:

                <ul>
                    <li><span>We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our agreement with

                    <li><span>We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may
                            process your personal data to send you marketing communications, to communicate with you
                            about changes to the TouchPoint Services, and to provide, secure, and improve the TouchPoint
                            Services.</span></li>

                <p>
                    If your personal data is subject to the GDPR or UK GDPR, we will transfer personal data from the EEA
                    to a location outside the EEA only when there has been a documented adequacy determination, or where
                    we have confirmed adequate privacy protections. If we transfer personal data to a third party acting
                    as our agent, we will also obligate the third party to have adequate privacy protections in place.

                <p>
                    If your personal data is subject to PIPEDA, we will transfer personal data from Canada to locations

                    We retain personal information about you for as long as necessary to provide you the Pension Savvy

                    Afterwards, we retain some information in a de-identified and/or aggregated form but not in a way
