                    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES
                    AND CLAIMS WITH PENSION SAVVY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
                </p>

                <p>
                    YOU AND PENSION SAVVY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY
                    WAY TO THESE TERMS OR THE PENSION SAVVY SERVICES SHALL BE FINALLY DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION
                    UNDER THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION GOVERNING CONSUMER DISPUTES.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arbitration uses a single, neutral arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury);
                    arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in a court case; and the arbitration process and
                    result is subject to very limited review by courts. In an arbitration you have the right, at your
                    expense, to be represented by an attorney of your choosing. Arbitrators can award the same damages
                    and relief under these Terms that a court can award under these Terms. You and Pension Savvy agree
                    that any in-person arbitral hearing would occur in the United States in the same county and state as
                    your billing address. Pension Savvy further agrees that your filing fee for an arbitration will be
                    capped at the amount set by the American Arbitration Association. You agree that, by agreeing to
                    these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                    provision, and that you and Pension Savvy are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and/or to
                    participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms
                    and the termination of your use of the Pension Savvy Services. Further, unless both you and Pension
                    Savvy agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate more than one person’s claims with
                    your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If
                    this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration
                    provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in
                    favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
                    warranted by that party’s individual claim.
